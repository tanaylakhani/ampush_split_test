# Ampush Split Test Challenge
* requires flask
* Application parses utm_id
* It is very basic right now, printing just a variable of the test (A,B,C,D,E). I'll need to create more elements on the UI side with condition checks

## To run:
run following inside project directory
```
python app.py
```
## Explored options:
